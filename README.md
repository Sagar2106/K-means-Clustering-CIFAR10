# K-means-Clustering-CIFAR10

K-Means Clustering on CIFAR-10 dataset with and without Autoencoder.

This project is from CSE 574 Intro to ML at University of Buffalo. This is purely intended for my collection. Do not use this for any future assignments.

Dataset: CIFAR-10 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pankrzysiu/cifar10-python

Task 1: Perform K-means clustering on CIFAR-10 from scratch.

Task 2: Implement AutoEncoder.
